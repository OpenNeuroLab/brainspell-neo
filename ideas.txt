Consider:
- A button to save all articles from a search as a collection
- Output the significance test as a NIFTI file
- add-article-manual endpoint, which allows users to add articles that arenâ€™t on PubMed. (potentially make PMID optional)
- Maybe an endpoint to get the titles (or all of the information) for a set of PMIDs.
- A cron job to automatically update DOIs.
