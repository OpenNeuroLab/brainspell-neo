Consider:
- A button to save all articles from a search as a collection
- Output the significance test as a NIFTI file
- add-article-manual endpoint, which allows users to add articles that aren’t on PubMed. (potentially make PMID optional)
- Make "add article" UI.
- Maybe an endpoint to get the titles (or all of the information) for a set of PMIDs.
- A validation for articles before they're sent to the bulk-add endpoint.
- A cron job to automatically update DOIs.


Github Functionality

- Store the PMID’s in each collection as well. 
- Integrate the two login systems 
- Add notes in each Article in the collection 
- Paginate the collections page 
- The bar should be a database request

Potentially reimplement:
- Tables: reimplement using jQuery Datatables 

- Brain Browser: a tool for visualization of translucent images that can take advantage of multi-core systems 

- Continuous Activation Graphic:
- Brainsprite: a tool that uses PNG files to show activation with depth
