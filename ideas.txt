Consider:
- A validation for articles before they're sent to the bulk-add endpoint.
- A cron job to automatically update DOIs.

GitHub:
- Potentially add notes in each article in the collection 
- Paginate the collections page 
- The bar should be a database request (what does this mean?)

Potentially reimplement:
- Tables: reimplement using jQuery Datatables 
- Brain Browser: a tool for visualization of translucent images that can take advantage of multi-core systems 
- Continuous Activation Graphic
- Brainsprite: a tool that uses PNG files to show activation with depth
