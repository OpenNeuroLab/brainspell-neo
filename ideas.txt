Consider:
- add-article-manual endpoint, which allows users to add articles that aren’t on PubMed. (potentially make PMID optional)
- Make "add article" UI.
- Maybe an endpoint to get the titles (or all of the information) for a set of PMIDs.
- A validation for articles before they're sent to the bulk-add endpoint.
- A cron job to automatically update DOIs.
