To do:

Main functionality:
- Create an API endpoint to edit tags, coordinates, authors for an article.
- Move the Brainspell Postgres database (whether to Pasteur or elsewhere).
- In late February, send the API specification to Roberto and JB again, for them to submit some final changes.
- Finalize API documentation (and put on GitHub)
- Add widgets to "view article" and (potentially) "search" pages
- Add API keys (associated with each account; potentially their password hash, which is checked before any database operations).
- Check if Unique PMID functionality actually prevents adding duplicate articles.
- Make sure that input to the database is sanitized (should be handled by ORM).

Not urgent:
- Add features for users to save articles, etc.
- Show a user’s own information (ratings, e.g.) if they’re logged in. (Detect with API key.)
- Make "add article" UI (won't necessarily work; we're over Heroku's database limit)
- add-article-manual endpoint, which allows users to add articles that aren’t on PubMed.
- Compute JSON diff and store with user metadata when a database operation is done.
- Potentially make a cron job to automatically update DOIs.
- Potentially use PubMed’s search results rather than querying our own database.
