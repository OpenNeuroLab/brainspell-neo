To do:

Main functionality:
- Add widgets to "view article" and (potentially) "search" pages
- Make "add article" UI (won't necessarily work; we're over Heroku's database limit)
- Make the URLs backwards-compatible with brainspell.org
- Clean/comment code thoroughly; clean up requirements.txt
- Write API documentation (and put on GitHub)

If users are really necessary:
- Set up login system, registration with hashing/salting
- Add features for users to save articles, add/vote on tags, etc.
