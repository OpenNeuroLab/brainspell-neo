To do:

Main functionality:
- Create an API endpoint to edit tags, coordinates, authors for an article.
- Move the Brainspell Postgres database (whether to Pasteur or elsewhere).
- Finalize API documentation with Roberto and JB, and put on GitHub.
- Add API keys (associated with each account; potentially their password hash, which is checked before any database operations).

Not urgent:
- Add features for users to save articles, etc. (add a user-metadata table)
- Show a user’s own information (ratings, e.g.) if they’re logged in. (Detect with API key.)
- Consider adding brain widget to search pages.
- add-article-manual endpoint, which allows users to add articles that aren’t on PubMed. (potentially make PMID optional)
- Make "add article" UI (won't necessarily work; we're over Heroku's database limit; might not be necessary)
- Compute JSON diff and store with user metadata when a database operation is done.
- Potentially make a cron job to automatically update DOIs.
